## Reservat Core

This is a scratchpad to work out the core mechanics of reservat.
Feel free to change/PR as appropriate, we need to work fast and break things as we go, mappings etc are subject to change, as will be queries
until we find the fastest method by which to serve the appropriate user data through the API.

Request config settings from me :D


## Why?

I believe that people want to `ability` so that they can `outcome`, and they would pay good money for that because `value`.

I believe that people want to serve reservations to online customers so that they can reduce friction with todays generation of phonophobes and have better oversight of their restaurant, and they would pay good money for that because the chances for upselling and trying to fill their restaurant, using accurate and realtime reporting will make them more profitable.
